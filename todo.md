### unsorting unreal ideas

- build for windows x64, freebsd x64
- reimplement mpegts split stream by segments, because have some problem with scramble streams (remux)
- make common m3u8 as optional (?)
- append RTSP(S) outut stream (seems only for commerce)
- todo RTSP(S) auth
- reload input channel if response 404 (seems for HLS refetch variant)
- www auth output, is it the RADIUS or file ?
- add relay options for simular work like udpxy (only arm build for openwrt ?)
- if input channel die(unavailable), write to HTTP(S)/? output 404 error
- concat HTTP(S) and HLS(S) input as one
- mmap for zerocopy
- switch chunks file/memory
- SAMPLE-AES for HLS/MP4 input/output
- key rotate/external for AES-128 HLS output
- setup duration HLS segment
- MP4 for HLS/DASH input/output
- DVB(S(2)/T(2)/C/...?)
- newcam proto for DVB
- WebSocket output for ... ?
- WEBRTC(SRTP/DTLS/SDP) for output (seems only for commerce)
- RTCP for robust RTP streaming
- improve loging system per input/output channel
- UDP cbr
- switch config system to flex/bison
- multi domain SSL for output
- make HTTP(S)/HLS(S) output as option and move it from cmdline to config
- strip OPENSSL size or switch to another SSL solution
- transcoding with lib ffmpeg(?) (seems only for commerce)
- coroutine per connections on thread (seems only for commerce)
- P2P live/vod streaming middleware (seems only for commerce)
- switch from C++0x to C++17
- H265
- TCP options nondelay, nopush, congestion
- RTMP for input/output, is it still need ?
- Akamai / AWS protocols
- make input ondemand
- switch input if no signal or more errors
- MPTS mux
- T2MI PLP demux/mux
- HTSP demux/mux
- DRM: google(Widevine),ms(PlayReady),addobe(PrimeTime),apple(Fairplay)
- timeshift
